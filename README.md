# Hitch 
This my attempt on creating visual scripting for Python.
 
 Note: This branch with the programm on pyqt4 is outdated. Work continues on PyQt5 branch.  
 
 From the last commit:
 ***Updated to PyQt5 due to my inability to get the OpenGL module compiled in my source build of PyQt source build***
